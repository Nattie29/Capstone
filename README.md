# Capstone Project AQI TO THE DEATH
by Nattawaree Piyarat

My capstone project

The Problem area: 
Can we use machine learning to predict how will the air quality index be in the next 5 years? Is there any relationship between air quality and health? Nowadays, we know what will impact air pollution. I would like to address the AQI and number of deaths in the world and compare between low AQI and high AQI areas.  
The User: 
The user will be the world population especially people in the high AQI area who are stressed from air pollution. The outcomes to be aware to create high chances of AQI. 
The Big Idea: 
The machine learning approach will be using historical AQI data, historical death causes data. And predict the relationship between air quality and the number of deaths which is assumed that caused by high AQI.
The Impact: 
The results of this project should raise awareness of air pollution and reduce the number of deaths of people by at least 1%. 
The Data: 
Dataset from WHO database (Air quality index, number of deaths by cause, pollution, dust, wildfire) 
Currently, I reference to datasets below.
•	Air quality index year 2000 – 2019 from WHO 
WHO. WHO Ambient Air Quality Database (update 2023). Version 6.0. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2023.
•	Number of deaths by cause year 2015 – 2019 from WHO
Next step
•	Study fact sheets and find some datasets about the causes of pollution and how they create bad air quality.
The Alternative: 
Southeast Asia countries are faced with air pollution every year. People are aware of their health and many people reported that PM2.5 causes respiratory disease. 


 The overview should reflect the structure of your Areas of Interest Submission, 
 explaining the Problem Area, 
 including those affected, 
 your proposed Data Science solution, 
 the impact of your solution, and a description of your dataset. 
 Any changes or refinements to your Area of Interest should be reflected in the README,
 and it is expected that your description of the data will be more granular 
 (including a Data Dictionary if feasible) compared to the Area of Interest submission.
